1. Project Overview
Muhammadiyah Welfare Home (MWH) is dedicated to providing care and support for boys residing on its campus, creating a nurturing environment to help them thrive. This Minimart and Voucher System aims to streamline requests for products, ensure transparent voucher allocation, and supply administrators with powerful management and reporting features.

The system was developed as part of Hack4Good, where participants collaborated to build a prototype that addresses real-world constraints and can be iteratively enhanced to maximize impact for MWH and its residents.

2. Key Features
For Residents
User-Friendly Dashboard: View voucher balances, transaction history, and available products.
Simple Requests: Request items from the minimart or place preorders for out-of-stock products.
Secure Login: Secure registration and login system with optional password reset (via mobile or email, depending on your configuration).
For Admins
User Management: Add new users, suspend accounts, and reset passwords.
Voucher Approvals: Approve or reject voucher tasks and product requests, with status updates and audit tracking.
Inventory Tracking: Maintain product inventory with an audit log for accountability.
Reporting: Generate weekly requests, inventory summaries, and other analytics for better decision-making.
3. Tech Stack
This project leverages a modern, modular approach. Below is an example stack; modify as necessary for your implementation:

Backend: Node.js / Express or Python / Django / Flask
Frontend: React.js / Vue.js / Angular
Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or session-based authentication
Hosting: Could be hosted on any cloud platform (AWS, Azure, Heroku, etc.)
4. Project Structure
A typical folder structure might look like the following (adapt to your actual files/folders):

Note: This README is placed at the root, containing general instructions. The backend and frontend directories each may have their own additional README files with more granular details.

5. Prerequisites
Node.js (v14+ recommended)
npm (v6+ recommended) or yarn
Git (to clone the repository)
Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB, depending on your choice)
(Optional) Python 3 (if the backend is built in Django/Flask instead of Node.js)
6. Installation & Setup
Backend Setup
Clone the repository

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/<username>/Minimart-Voucher-System.git
cd Minimart-Voucher-System/backend
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy
npm install
or

bash
Copy
yarn install
Create your .env file
Copy the .env.example into a new file .env, then update the variables (see Environment Variables).

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory

bash
Copy
cd ../frontend
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy
npm install
or

bash
Copy
yarn install
Configuration

Update any environment variables or API endpoints in the frontend configuration (e.g., .env file or config files) to point to your backend server.
7. Environment Variables
In the root of the backend directory, you have an .env.example (or .env) file that includes essential configurations. Example variables might include:

makefile
Copy
# Backend environment variables
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=xxxxxx
SENDGRID_API_KEY=xxxxxx

# Frontend environment variables
REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3001
Remember not to commit your actual secrets to GitHub or any public repository.

8. Database Migrations
If your framework supports migrations (e.g., using sequelize or Django migrations):

Initialize database
bash
Copy
npx sequelize db:create
or the relevant command for your chosen ORM.
Run migrations
bash
Copy
npx sequelize db:migrate
or:
bash
Copy
python manage.py migrate
(depending on your setup)
Make sure the database is properly configured in your .env file before running migrations.

9. Running the Application
Start the Backend

bash
Copy
cd backend
npm start
or

bash
Copy
yarn start
This should start the backend server at http://localhost:3001 (or whichever port you’ve configured).

Start the Frontend

bash
Copy
cd ../frontend
npm start
or

bash
Copy
yarn start
This typically starts the frontend development server at http://localhost:3000.

Access the Application

Frontend: Go to http://localhost:3000.
Backend: API endpoints can be tested on http://localhost:3001/api/....
10. Testing
Backend Tests
From the backend folder, run:

bash
Copy
npm test
or

bash
Copy
yarn test
This should execute all test scripts (e.g., using Jest, Mocha, or PyTest).

Frontend Tests
From the frontend folder, run:

bash
Copy
npm test
or

bash
Copy
yarn test
This typically runs tests using Jest and React Testing Library (if you’re using React).

Integration Testing
You may implement additional integration or end-to-end tests using Cypress, Selenium, or Playwright.

11. Future Enhancements
The current system is a prototype that focuses on the Minimart and Voucher workflow. Planned future enhancements include:

Auctions / Bidding Feature: Users can bid on special items using their vouchers.
Mobile App Integration: A mobile application for iOS/Android to further streamline user and admin interactions.
Advanced Analytics: Data visualization tools for inventory forecasts and user behavior insights.
Notification System: Real-time alerts for voucher approvals, inventory restocks, and system announcements.
